# Dofus Market

Bot to monitor item prices of all [Dofus 2](https://www.dofus.com) servers. The bot was
very loud so it quickly got banned but it was fun to do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The bot written in .NET would scrap the item prices from auction houses, send them to an
ASP.NET Core app that would write them into a TimescaleDB and exposed in a Grafana.
